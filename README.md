# Automatic Orientation of Complete Mandibles 

Super exciting features include:
- batch import of six-column .xyz files (3 columns of vertices, 3 columns of normals) representing point clouds of complete mandibles
- automatic alignment of said point clouds to a standard orientation
- semi-manual backface culling

Other exciting features to come:
- automatic slicing, orienting, and backface culling, ready for import into ArcGIS
- batch everything; just put in a load of .xyz files and wait
- even more sarcasm, despair, and unnecessary sleepless nights!
