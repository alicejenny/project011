\usage{
batch(align = TRUE, slice = TRUE)
}
\description{
Calls align2 (and thus various other functions) in order to import and align a series of.xyz files. Files must be 6 columns until I have the time to change it.
Will be updated later to include other functions/make it run a bit better.
No variables needed (see example).
